<p>"Aaron was super responsive,flexible, and professional. 
He very carefully moved a number of large plants for me
and made multiple stops, communicating with me along the
way (and the very next day from my request, too!) The plants
are sensitive and were in great shape because he knew how to
handle them properly. I would definitely work with Aaron again
and recommend him."

<p>"Aaron and his crew were super professional, friendly, and efficient!
They had positive energy and Aaron was very personable. They helped me
move from East Village (on the sixth floor walkup too!) to Greenpoint and
made sure all my items were handled with care. Aaron super willing to help
me mount my tv after the move as well. I will definitely book Aaron in the
future and can't recommend enough!"

<p>"Aaron took on a move for us that involved multiple boxes
and a couple of rooms of furniture. He had to partially disassemble
some of the furniture to get it through the doors before transporting
it and reassemble it in the new apartment - no problem. He and his team
carried everything up 3 flights of stairs - no problem. He placed every
piece of furniture where we wanted it and did an awesome job - no problem,
and not a nick or scratch on anything, including the walls! If you want a
problem-free move, I HIGHLY recommend Aaron T. He is a true professional
and we will definitely contact him if we need to move again!"
